# Zustand Context Web

This project demonstrates the use of React Context API and Zustand for state management in a React application. Users can navigate between different pages to see each state management solution in action.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and a package manager (like npm, yarn, or pnpm) installed on your environment.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/eliasmelgaco/zustand-context.git
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies using your preferred package manager:
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

## Usage

To start the development server, run the following command:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3030/`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts with your package manager:

-   `dev`: Runs the app in the development mode.
-   `build`: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
-   `test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
-   `lint`: Lints the project for potential errors.
-   `lint:fix`: Lints the project and fixes fixable errors.
-   `format`: Formats the code using Prettier.
-   `check-types`: Checks for TypeScript errors.
-   `preview`: Serves the production build locally.


## Linting and Formatting

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting.

To lint the code, run:

```sh
yarn lint
```

To automatically fix linting errors, run:

```sh
yarn lint:fix
```

To format the code, run:

```sh
yarn format
```

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```sh
yarn build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the production-ready files.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```sh
yarn test
```
